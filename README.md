# EventsApp

![grab-landing-page](https://github.com/Githublearner22/EventsGif/blob/master/Events%20App%20CRUD.gif)

This is a Django-based Events Management Application with CRUD features.

Using videos from John Elder from Codemy, I have completed a Django-based Events management website with CRUD feature. Lots of credit to him for his guidance. Credit also goes to Django for Beginners book and Victoria Sacre from QA Academy for getting the grasp of using Python and Django.

Difficulties has been trying to make sure I have not messed up with commas and uppercase letters. The front end aspect of this project can be improved. Given the time frame, I have succeeded in having to show after studing Python and Django for 2 weeks. Looking to write better comments throughout text. Cleaner writing of HTML is what I need to work on too. Struggled with using GIT in having extra branches.

Improvements:
Go back to the basics with Python. Look at classes and variables. Look at HTML as well.


Learning more deeply about the MVT model and how HTTP work in this application. Improvements, read more documentation on having better understanding on environment variables, SSH keys, database management in Django.
